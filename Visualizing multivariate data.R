##### Scatterplots are standard for for representing
# continuous bivariate data, but can be used to
# accomodate other variables

# look at basic scatterplot of manu and popul

# character variables for labels:
mlab <- "Manufacturing enterprises with 20 or more workers"
plab <- "Population size (1970 census) in thousands"

# call plot() high-level function, note formula
# describing variables to be plotted
plot(popul ~ manu, data = USairpollution, 
     xlab = mlab, ylab = plab)

# Can see outliers, will come back to this

# Let's look at marginal distributions
# with rug plots, they show where actual
# points lie

plot(popul ~ manu, data = USairpollution, 
     xlab = mlab, ylab = plab)
# put rug symbols on horizontal
rug(USairpollution$manu, side = 1)
# puts rug symbols on vertical
rug(USairpollution$popul, side = 2)

# Now we show marginal distributions
# another way

# first divide up the plotting area into
# three areas so can draw a scatterplot,
# histogram and boxplot

?layout

# matrix shows locations of plots
layout(matrix(c(2, 0, 1, 3), 
              nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE),

# adds text to plot, we use abbreviated names
# of city as plotting symbols
with(USairpollution, text(manu, popul, cex = 0.6,
     labels=abbreviate(row.names(USairpollution))))

# draws histogram as marginal distribution
# of manufacturing; with() function allows us
# to extract variables from dataframe...hist()
# and boxplot() are evaluated INSIDE of the 
# dataframe USairpollution
with(USairpollution, 
     hist(manu, main = "", xlim = xlim))

# draws boxplot as marginal distribution
# population size of city
with(USairpollution, boxplot(popul))

# We see that outlying points show themselves
# in both the scatterplot of the variables AND
# in each marginal distribution. Most extreme
# outlier is Chicago, also Philly and Detroit

# So big cities have big manufacturing facil.

### The Bivariate Boxplot

# Let's look for more formal and objective
# method for labelling observations as outliers

# Bivariate boxplot is a 2D analogue of boxplot
# for univariate data, can show distributional
# properties of the data in identifying 
# possible outliers.

# Is based on calculating 'robust' measures of
# location, scale and correlation. It consists
# of pair of concentric ellipses, on is the
# 'hinge' and the other the 'fence' which
# delineates outliers

# Regression lines of both y on x and x on y
# with intersection showing bivariate location
# estimator; Acute angle between regression
# lines will be small for a large absolute
# value of correlations and large for a small
# one.

# Create scatterplot of manu and popul including
# bivariate boxplot

# going to see if these cities are outliers:
outcity <- match(lab <- c("Chicago", "Detroit", 
    "Cleveland", "Philadelphia", "Houston"), 
                 rownames(USairpollution))
# extract manu and popul variables from df
x <- USairpollution[, c("manu", "popul")]
# draw bivariate boxplot (must load MVA package)
# middle circle contains 50% of points; lines
# are inverted regression lines of man and pop
bvbox(x, mtitle = "", xlab = mlab, ylab = plab)
# lable those five cities
text(x$manu[outcity], x$popul[outcity], 
     labels = lab, cex = 0.7, 
     pos = c(2, 2, 4, 2, 2))

# Chicago, Philly, Detroit and Cleveland are
# outliers, but not Houston since is on the
# 'fence'

# Suppose now we want to calculate correlation
# between manu and popul, should always look
# at scatterplot first because outliers can
# distort correlation coefficient.

# So we exclude those four cities and calculate

# cor() computes pearson product corr
with(USairpollution, cor(manu, popul))

# four outlier cities matched with dataframe
outcity <- match(c("Chicago", "Detroit", 
                   "Cleveland", "Philadelphia"),
                 rownames(USairpollution))

# compute the correlations without them
with(USairpollution, cor(manu[-outcity], 
                         popul[-outcity]))

# correlation goes from 0.96 to 0.80

### The Convex Hull of Bivariate Data

# alternative to using scatterplot with
# bivariate boxplot is to calculate corr without
# outliers is 'convex hull trimming' which
# allows 'robust estimation' of the correlation

# Convex hull of a set of bivariate observations
# is 'vertices of smallest convex polyhedron in
# variable space within which on upon which all
# data points lie'

# Removing points lying on the convex hull can
# eliminate isolated outliers without disturbing
# the general shape of the bivariate distrib

# Calculate robust est of corr from remaining obs

# We find convex hull of our data

?chull

# gives us observations on the hull
(hull <- with(USairpollution, 
              chull(manu, popul)))

# this just plots all points:
with(USairpollution, 
     plot(manu, popul, pch = 1, 
          xlab = mlab, ylab = plab))

# plots the polygon
with(USairpollution, 
     # reference hull points with subscripts:
     polygon(manu[hull], popul[hull],
             # number and angle of lines:
             density = 15, angle = 30))

# Calculate correlation and removing points
# on convex hull
with(USairpollution,
     cor(manu[-hull],
         popul[-hull]))

# corr is 0.9225, higher than correlation 0.80
# removing outliers from bivariate boxplot

#### The Chi-Plot
# Augments scatterplot to highlight independence.
# Chi-plot transforms x, y values in scatterplot
# into values to show deviations from independence
# using chi-square tables

# scatterplot:
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
with(USairpollution, plot(manu, popul, 
                          xlab = mlab, 
                          ylab = plab, 
                          cex.lab = 0.9))

# chi-plot:
with(USairpollution, chiplot(manu, popul))

# Points that are NOT in the horizontal band
# indicate a departure from independence.

##### The Bubble and Other Glyph Plots
# To include more than 2 variables in scatterplot

# Bubble plot is the simplest: third variable
# represented by radii of circles proportioned
# to values

# Bubble plot of temp, wind, SO2:

ylim <- with(USairpollution, 
             # spreads out y axis:
             range(wind)) * c(0.95, 1)
#draws scatterplot:
plot(wind ~ temp, data = USairpollution, 
     xlab="Average annual temperature (Fahrenheit)",
     ylab="Average annual wind speed (m.p.h.)", 
     pch=10,
     ylim=ylim)
# adds bubbles:
with(USairpollution, 
     # size of circles tied to SO2:
     # centered on temp and wind:
     symbols(temp, wind, circles = SO2,
             # scales size of symbols and
             # adds symbols to existing plot
             inches = 0.5, add = TRUE))

?symbols

# Cities with moderate annual temps and wind
# speeds have greatest air pollution, but may
# be more variables involved

# Include all variables in basic temp and wind
# scatterplot by replacing circles with 5-sided
# stars with lengths of each side representing
# another variable

# spatial positions of cities in wind, temp
# scatterplot are combined with star repre of
# five other variables:
plot(wind ~ temp, data = USairpollution,
     xlab="Average annual temperature (Fahrenheit)",
     ylab="Average annual wind speed (m.p.h.)", 
     pch = 10, ylim=ylim)
with(USairpollution,
     # draws stars without temp or wind
    stars(USairpollution[,-c(2,5)], 
          locations = cbind(temp, wind),
          labels = NULL, add = TRUE, cex = 0.5))

# But stars plot fails to show anything conclusive

# Bubble and stars plots examples of symbol
# or 'glyph plots' in which data values control
# symbol parameters

# Could also simply represent all variables as
# side of 7-sided star and arrange resulting 
# stars in rectangular array
stars(USairpollution, cex = 0.55)

# N.O., Miami, Jax, Atl have similar shapes with
# distinctive higher average annual temps

##### The Scatterplot Matrix
# plots all pairs of numeric variables

# use enlarged dot symbols; can see outliers,
# non-linear precip with predays and SO2
pairs(USairpollution, pch = ".", cex = 3)

# strong linear manu and popul. Scatterplot
# matrix helpful for interpreting corr matrix:
# look at SO2 row with scatter matrix
round(cor(USairpollution), 4) 

# add regression lines for linear fits
pairs(USairpollution, 
      panel = function (x, y, ...) {
          points(x, y, ...)
          abline(lm(y ~ x), col = "grey")
      }, pch = ".", cex = 1.5)
